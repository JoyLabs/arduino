=======
We play with arduino, and share the code here.

Libraries available:
 * LCD/LCD5110 - A revised LCD5110 class based on DFRobot code. It just ok, quick and dirty, far beyond good though.
 * RFID/MFRC522 - Driver for MFRC522 chip that supports Philips MF-1 card read and write. Based on code from the net and refactored to C++ class.
 * Keypad/AnalogKeypad - A simple keypad class that use only 1 analog input to support 4-direction keys.
